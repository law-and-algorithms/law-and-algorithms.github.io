<p>
Human-designed algorithms -- from the digital to the genetic -- reach ever more deeply into our lives, creating alternate and sometimes enhanced manifestations of social and biological processes. In doing so, algorithms yield powerful levers for good and ill amidst a sea of unforeseen consequences. This cross-cutting and interdisciplinary course investigates several aspects of algorithms and their impact on society and law. Specifically, the course connects concepts of proof, verifiability, privacy, security, and trust in computer science with legal concepts of autonomy, consent, governance, and liability, and examines interests at the evolving intersection of DNA technology and the law.
</p>

<p>
This seminar consists of weekly meetings through the Fall 2018 semester, to be attended simultaneously by faculty, students and scholars based at Harvard, Berkeley, Columbia and Boston
University thanks to the IT support of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard
University. Sessions will be held every Thursday at 3-5pm EST.

<h2 id="class-format-and-project">Course Assignment</h2>
<p>The main assignment in the course will be writing a position paper on a topic related to the material discussed in class. (We will also have a list of suggested topics.) The paper will be written by groups of 2 or 3 students, where each group must contain at least one law student and one CS student.</p>

<p>
Students will be expected to work together to write a 5000-7500-word memo that identifies and
provides background on the selected issue and outlines solutions. References and citations are
essential, and should be included as footnotes.</p>

<p>
For cross-institutional groups: the course team will try to assist students to travel in order to
collaborate on the class project.</p>

      <td>Analysis of Safeguard Implementation Against Governmental Automated Risk-Assessment Mechanisms</td>
      <td>
      	In the last decade, advancement and proliferation of big data processing mechanisms have made it easier for governmental entities to enforce standards and requirements on both citizens and non-citizens utilizing large reservoirs of data.

		This paper seeks to analyze governmental “risk-assessment” systems which use voluntarily and involuntarily obtained data to determine peoples’ rights. Specifically, we’ll be detailing transparency concerns, analyzing various definitions of fairness, and examining multilateral cost-bearing. A variety of case studies will assist with developing a standardized set of potential technical requirements to mitigate abuse and maximize fairness while contextualizing the technologies with their intended purposes.

      <td>Antitrust Legislation for Decentralized Consensus - Cryptocurrency Mining and Distributed File Storage</td>
      <td>Decentralized platforms such as Bitcoin and IPFS utilize individual
computation and hardware contribution to function. The fairness of
these platforms relies on the ideal assumption that mining power is
distributed equally since all individuals are equally likely to mine a
block. However, in reality this is not the case as groups of
individuals have agreed to form mining pools such that they have a
larger percentage of the overall network and are more likely to
receive block rewards. We see that there is an immediate parallel
between mining pools and the formation of monopolies within
traditional industries as both topics involve the mutual agreement of
parties to restrict competition.

We wish to explore the implications of antitrust legislation and how
it should address applications utilizing decentralized consensus
mechanisms, such as cryptocurrency mining pools or distributed file
storage. There are many things to consider, such as legitimacy of
government interference, liability with creators/users/maintainers,
and even the legal designation of  decentralized organizations; in
these cases, it is also difficult to determine what constitutes
legitimate economic or social cause for antitrust legislation to be
imposed. As the world tends towards decentralization (in the form of
cryptocurrencies, payments, trustless systems, and DAOs), it is
important to further understand the social and legal consequences. We
wish to explore these controversial topics, establish a systemized way
of analyzing decentralized systems from a legal/social perspective,
and devise schemes to ensure fairness among all parties.</td>

In other words, a discussion of two interactive trends: blockchain (providing a new service which creates a decentralized method of record keeping) versus privacy laws (the right to be forgotten) and how this governs court decisions.

Regulated or not, blockchain evidence can be helpful given that it’s a system of “trust” time stamped and validated. We will compare the theoretical acceptance of blockchain technology evidence with how social media evidence has been received in court and the methods under which social media evidence is accepted during trial. (For example, currently social media evidence is gathered through either an affidavit approved by someone (the evidence shows the date, time and content of the post) or using a witness.) We will explore the traces left by blockchain evidence, and the question of if the purchaser/user or the producer of the network is liable if something goes wrong. The paper will also address the regulatory obligations for record keeping. Contrasting EU regulations and US laws as well as the role of regulators to show the need for global agreement because otherwise it won’t work [Indian regulation, Brazil, Asia, EU].
